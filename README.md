Pi-Squared-Inc Public Code
==========================

This repository contains code made public by [Pi Squared][pi2].


Legacy Code
-----------

The `v2024-Q1` branch contains old implementations of proof checkers we
have previously released publicly. It's now out of date, but is still here
if you wish to examine it. If you had a link to the "Experiments and
Evaluation of ZK Backends" document at `Performance.md`, you can [now find
that here][v2024-Q1-perf.md]
